                    If you ignore the slightly eccentric career choice, I'm basically what happens when you hit "Default" in an RPG character creator. House, wife, kids, back pain, and a certified touch of madness. Oh, and I collect Pokémon cards.
                    Professionally, I do the exact thing I used to hate as a sysadmin: breaking stuff. After 13 years of hardening systems, I found out it's way more fun to join the dark side. 
                    These days, I work as a Senior Pentester and Red Team Operator. Or, as my wife puts it: "ten windows full of white text on a black screen."
                    I love challenges, brain puzzles, and anything you can hack. Gamification didn't make it better. Thanks HackTheBox...
                    When I'm not lurking around other people's networks or spending quality time with the family, you'll probably find me gaming, organizing my Pokémon cards, or desperately trying not to get into D&D or Warhammer 40K (I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out, send help).

                <p>
                    I believe that by openly discussing and sharing offensive techniques, we collectively improve our
                    defensive capabilities. Attackers already know these methods. Defenders deserve to as well.
